# Ansible Role: Docker

An Ansible Role that installs [Docker](https://www.docker.com) on Linux. For Ubuntu/Debian only. Docker with Nftables.

Source: https://gist.github.com/goll/bdd6b43c2023f82d15729e9b0067de60.

## Requirements

None.

## Role Variables

Available variables are listed below, along with default values (see `defaults/main.yml`):

    # Edition can be one of: 'ce' (Community Edition) or 'ee' (Enterprise Edition).
    docker_edition: 'ce'
    docker_package: "docker-{{ docker_edition }}"
    docker_package_state: present

The `docker_edition` should be either `ce` (Community Edition) or `ee` (Enterprise Edition). You can also specify a specific version of Docker to install `docker-{{ docker_edition }}=<VERSION>`.

You can control whether the package is installed, uninstalled, or at the latest version by setting `docker_package_state` to `present`, `absent`, or `latest`, respectively. Note that the Docker daemon will be automatically restarted if the Docker package is updated. This is a side effect of flushing all handlers (running any of the handlers that have been notified by this and any other role up to this point in the play).

    docker_service_state: started
    docker_service_enabled: true
    docker_restart_handler_state: restarted

Variables to control the state of the `docker` service, and whether it should start on boot. If you're installing Docker inside a Docker container without systemd or sysvinit, you should set these to `stopped` and set the enabled variable to `no`.

    docker_install_compose: true
    docker_compose_version: "1.26.0"
    docker_compose_path: /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Docker Compose installation options.

    docker_apt_release_channel: stable
    docker_apt_arch: amd64
    docker_apt_repository: "deb [arch={{ docker_apt_arch }}] https://download.docker.com/linux/{{ ansible_distribution | lower }} {{ ansible_distribution_release }} {{ docker_apt_release_channel }}"
    docker_apt_ignore_key_error: True
    docker_apt_gpg_key: https://download.docker.com/linux/{{ ansible_distribution | lower }}/gpg

You can switch the channel to `nightly` if you want to use the Nightly release.

You can change `docker_apt_gpg_key` to a different url if you are behind a firewall or provide a trustworthy mirror.
Usually in combination with changing `docker_apt_repository` as well.

    docker_users:
      - user1
      - user2

A list of system users to be added to the `docker` group (so they can use Docker on the server).

## Dependencies

None.

## Example Playbook
